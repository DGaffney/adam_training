=============

A training repository for teaching Adam Sinatra, Mongo, Ruby, and general development.

Basic flow for git:

1. make changes all over the place. 
2. "git add ." from the root folder of the project.
3. "git commit -a -m 'A message'" commits all changes (-a) with a message (-m).
4. "git pull origin master" pulls all changes from the main branch of the project, always called "master" (no need to worry about branching yet)
4a. May have merge conflicts. We will discuss that separately.
5. "git push origin master" pushes the changes to git for all other programmers on the project to pull down.
